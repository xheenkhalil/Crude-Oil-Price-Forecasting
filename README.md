# Crude Oil Price Forecasting using SARIMA Model
Forecasting prices of crude oil in Nigeria for the next 10 years.


This project involves the application of time series analysis, specifically the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, to forecast crude oil prices. The analysis includes various statistical tests and the generation of both yearly and monthly forecasts over a 10-year period.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to predict future crude oil prices using historical data and to assess the performance of the SARIMA model through various statistical tests and evaluations.

### Key Components:
1. **Time Series Forecasting**: We use the SARIMA model for forecasting crude oil prices, accounting for seasonality and trends over time.
2. **Statistical Testing**: The project includes stationarity tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and evaluates model performance based on fit statistics.
3. **10-Year Forecast**: Both monthly and yearly forecasts for crude oil prices have been generated, offering insights into long-term trends.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The SARIMA model is evaluated using metrics such as AIC, BIC, and coefficient analysis.

## SARIMA Model

The SARIMA model is well-suited for forecasting seasonal time series data. It extends the ARIMA model by adding seasonal components, which makes it a good choice for analyzing crude oil prices that exhibit seasonal patterns.

### Model Fit Statistics:
- **AIC**: Akaike Information Criterion
- **BIC**: Bayesian Information Criterion
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error

### Coefficients:
- The SARIMA model coefficients provide insight into the relationship between past observations and future values, taking into account autoregressive and moving average components, both seasonal and non-seasonal.

## Forecast Results

Two forecasts were generated:
- **Monthly Forecast**: Provides insights into how crude oil prices might fluctuate month-to-month over the next 10 years.
- **Yearly Forecast**: Summarizes the expected yearly trends in crude oil prices over the next decade.

## Usage

To run the project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xheenkhalil/Crude-Oil-Price-Forecasting.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies (ensure you have Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Statsmodels, and other necessary libraries installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open `app.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis and forecast results:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook app.ipynb
   ```

## Results and Conclusions

The SARIMA model performed well in capturing the seasonal fluctuations and trend patterns in the crude oil price data. The model's forecasts provide useful insights into future price movements, with a focus on both monthly and yearly projections. However, due to the complexity of crude oil markets and external factors, the forecasts should be interpreted with caution.
